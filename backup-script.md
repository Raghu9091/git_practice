# üß∞ Shell Script Backup ‚Äì Real-world Lesson

This document explains a real scenario faced during the automation of a log backup process using a shell script. It includes the problem encountered, solution implemented, and the final working script.

---

## üìù Task

Write a shell script to:

1. Find `.log` files older than 14 days from a source directory  
2. Zip them and move the archive to a destination directory  
3. Delete the original log files from the source  
4. Log all actions and errors to a log file  

---

## ‚úÖ Initial Success

- Script tested with a single log file ‚Äî worked perfectly  
- Scheduled the script using `crontab` for automation  

---

## ‚ùå Problem Faced

After a few days, the number of `.log` files in the source directory increased and the script started failing.

**Root Cause:**  
The variable `$FILES` contained multiple filenames ‚Äî some with **spaces or newlines**.  
This line failed:


```bash
echo $FILES | zip -@ "$ZIP_FILE"
```
### Fix Implemented:
Replaced:
```bash
echo $FILES | zip -@ "$ZIP_FILE"
```
With:
```
echo "$FILES" | tr ' ' '\n' | zip -@ "$ZIP_FILE"
```

This ensures each filename is correctly passed to zip using newline delimiters.

‚úÖ After the change, the script worked even when the directory had many .log files with spaces in names.
